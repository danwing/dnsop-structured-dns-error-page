      <t>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
   DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the
   reason for the filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to
   end users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an
   HTTPS website.</t>
      <t>This document defines a mechanism to explain the reason
      for the DNS filtering and provides HTTPS URIs to get more
      detail. This information can be parsed by the client and
      displayed, logged, or used for other purposes.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>DNS filters are deployed for a variety of reasons including
      endpoint security, parental filtering, and filtering required by
      law enforcement.  Network-based security solutions such as
      firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely upon
      network traffic inspection to implement perimeter-based security
      policies and operate by filtering DNS responses.  In a home, DNS
      filtering is used for the same reasons as above and additionally
      for parental control.  Internet Service Providers typically
      block access to some DNS domains due to a requirement imposed by
      an external entity (e.g., law enforcement agency) also performed
      using DNS-based content filtering.</t>
      <t>Users of DNS services which perform filtering may wish to
   receive more information about such filtering to resolve problems
   with the filter -- for example to contact the administrator to
   whitelist a domain that was erroneously filtered or to understand
   the reason a particular domain was filtered.  With that information,
   the user can choose another network, open a trouble ticket with
   the DNS administrator to resolve erroneous filtering, log the
      information, or other uses.</t>

      <t>Two DNS filtering mechanisms are widely deployed today but are
      harmful:</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
        <dt>empty answer or NXDOMAIN:</dt>
        <dd>The simplest mechanism is simply returning an empty
	    answer or NXDOMAIN.  This provides no information to the
	    client and makes the network or its DNS feel broken
	    because of the 'host not found' error messages typically
	    presented to the user.  This mechanism also interferes
	    with client DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers because the
	    empty answer has an invalid (or missing) signature.</dd>
        <dt>Forged response:</dt>
        <dd>This mechanism returns a forged A (or AAAA) response
      pointing at a host operated by the DNS operator.  The
      expectation is the user's browser will visit the server over
      HTTP and a suitable explanation will be displayed to the user.
      As HTTPS is now commonplace, this expectation breaks down because
      clients are presented with a warning about visiting an
      un-trusted site (because of an un-trusted certificate), or those
      users are encouraged to install the certificate as an additional
      trusted root, eroding their security for all TLS connections.
      Furthermore, for the user to see the DNS filtering explanation
      the user needs a web browser which visits the server and often
      require JavaScript, creating a wider attack surface.  The
      requirement for a web browser is, itself, a problem on some
      devices (e.g., IoT or headless devices).  Finally, this mechanism
      interferes with client DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers because
      the forged response has an invalid (or missing) signature.</dd>
      </dl>
      -->
      
      <t>DNS responses can be filtered by sending a bogus (also called,
   "forged") A or AAAA response, NXDOMAIN error or empty answer, or an
   extended DNS error (EDE) code defined in <xref target="RFC8914"/>.  Each of these
   methods have advantages and disadvantages that are discussed below:</t>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <t>The DNS response is forged to provide a list of IP addresses that
       points to an HTTP(S) server alerting the end user about the
       reason for blocking access to the requested domain (e.g.,
       malware).  When an HTTP(S) enabled domain name is blocked, the
       network security device (e.g., CPE, firewall) presents a block
       page instead of the HTTP response from the content provider
       hosting that domain.  If an HTTP enabled domain name is blocked,
       the network security device intercepts the HTTP request and
       returns a block page over HTTP.  If an HTTPS enabled domain is
       blocked, the block page is also served over HTTPS.  In order to
       return a block page over HTTPS, man in the middle (MITM) is
       enabled on endpoints by generating a local root certificate and
       an accompanying (local) public/private key pair.  The local root
       certificate is installed on the endpoint while the network
       security device(s) stores a copy of the private key.  During the
       TLS handshake, the network security device modifies the
       certificate provided by the server and (re)signs it using the
   private key from the local root certificate.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
          is not a viable option in several deployments like home
          networks, schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), and Small/
          Medium Enterprise (SME).  In these cases, the typical behavior
          is that the forged DNS response directs the user towards a
          server hosted to display the block page which breaks the TLS
          connection.  For web-browsing this then results in an HTTPS
          certificate error message indicating that a secure connection
          could not be established, which gives no information to the
          end-user about the reason for the error.
          The typical errors are "The security certificate presented by
          this website was not issued by a trusted certificate
          authority" (Internet Explorer/Edge"), "The site's security
          certificate is not trusted" (Chrome), "This Connection is
          Untrusted" (Firefox), "Safari can't verify the identity of the
          website..." (Safari on MacOS)".</t>
            </li>
            <li>Enterprise networks do not assume that all the connected
          devices are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device Management
          (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common Bring Your Own
          Device (BYOD) scenario.  In addition, the local root
          certificate cannot be installed on IoT devices without a
          device management tool.</li>
            <li>An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
          consequently, may repeatedly try to reach the domain but with
          no success.  Frustrated, the end user may switch to an
          alternate network that offers no DNS-level protection against
          malware and phishing, potentially compromising both security
          and privacy.  Furthermore, certificate errors train users to
          click through certificate errors, which is a bad security
          practice.  To eliminate the need for an end user to click
          through certificate errors, an end user may manually install a
          local root certificate on a host device.  Doing so, however, is also a bad
          security practice as it creates a security vulnerability that
          may be exploited by a MITM attack.  When a manually installed
          local root certificate expires, the user has to (again)
          manually install the new local root certificate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to
       cause the DNS lookup to terminate in failure.  In this case, an
       end user does not know why the domain cannot be reached and may
       repeatedly try to reach the domain but with no success.
       Frustrated, the end user may use insecure connections to reach
       the domain, potentially compromising both security and privacy.</li>
        <li>The extended error codes Blocked, Censored, and Filtered defined in
       <xref target="RFC8914">Section 4 of</xref> can be returned by a DNS server to
       provide additional information about the cause of an DNS error.
       If the extended error code "Forged Answer" defined in <xref target="RFC8914">Section 4.5
       of</xref> is returned by the DNS server, the client can
       identify the DNS response is forged together with the reason for
       HTTPS certificate error.</li>
        <li>These extended error codes do not suffer from the limitations
       discussed in bullets (1) and (2), but the user still does not
       know the exact reason nor he/she is aware of the exact entity
       blocking the access to the domain.  For example, a DNS server may
       block access to a domain based on the content category such as
       "Adult Content" to enforce parental control, "Violence &amp;
       Terrorism" due to an external requirement imposed by an external
       entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency), etc.  These content
       categories cannot be standardized because the classification of
       domains into content categories is vendor specific, typically
       ranges from 40 to 100 types of categories depending on the vendor
       and the categories keep evolving.  Furthermore, the threat data
       used to categorize domains may sometimes misclassify domains
       (e.g., domains wrongly classified as Domain Generation Algorithm
       (DGA) by deep learning techniques, domain wrongly classified as
       phishing due to crowd sourcing, new domains not categorized by
       the threat data).  A user needs to know the contact details of
       the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</li>
        <li>When a resolver or
   forwarder forwards the received EDE option, the EXTRA-TEXT field
   only conveys the source of the error (Section 3 of [RFC8914]) and
   does not provide additional textual information about the cause of
   the error.</li>
      </ol>


      <t>For both DNS filtering mechanisms described above, the DNS
      server can return extended error codes Blocked, Censored,
      Filtered, or Forged Answer defined in <xref target="RFC8914">Section 4 of</xref>.
      However, these codes only
      explain that filtering occurred but lack detail for the user to
      diagnose erroneous filtering.</t>


      <t>No matter which type of response is generated (forged IP address(es),
   NXDOMAIN or empty answer, even with an extended error code), the user who
   triggered the DNS query has little chance to understand which entity
   filtered the query, how to report a mistake in the filter, or why the
   entity filtered it at all.  This document describes a mechanism to
   provide such detail.</t>

   <t>One of the other benefits of this approach is to eliminate the need
   to "spoof" block pages for HTTPS resources.  This is achieved since
   clients implementing this approach would be able to display a
   meaningful error message, and would not need to connect to such a block page.
   This approach thus avoids the need to install a
   local root certificate authority on those IT-managed devices.</t>
   
      <t>This document describes a protocol containing parsable data
      in a new <xref target="RFC6891" format="default">EDNS(0)</xref>
      option code.</t>
      
      <t>Clients indicate their support of this specification in their
      DNS query so the DNS server can tailor its DNS response
      accordingly.  The information returned in a DNS response allows
      combinations of headless devices (i.e., those lacking a display
      or other means to communicate with a human), operating systems,
      and web browsers to be informed of the filtering.  This
      information returned can be logged and/or displayed to the user,
      as appropriate for the user interface capabilities of the client
      hardware and software.</t>

   <t>This document does not recomment DNS filtering, but provides a
   mechanism for better transparency to explain to the users why some 
   DNS queries are filtered.</t>

      the complaint URI is RECOMMENDED to include sufficient detail to determine
      the filtering state when the DNS filtering occurred.  If and how this is
      encoded into the complaint URI is an implementation decision.</t>

        <name>Client Processing Response</name>
        <t>On receipt of the DNS response, the following
      actions are performed specific to Structured Error EDNS(0) option, in no particular order:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>The requestor MUST verify that the response was received over an encrypted DNS channel.</li>
          <li>If the DNS response contains more than one Structured Error EDNS(0)
	option, the requestor MUST discard all Structured Error ENDS(0) options.</li>
          <li>The DNS response MUST also contain an extended error code
	of "Censored", "Blocked", "Filtered" or "Forged", otherwise
	the Structured Error EDNS(0) option is discarded.</li>
		<li>
	  The Requestor expands the values in "c" and "r" by prefixing the
	  two values with "https://" and the value of the "d" value.
	  Then the Requestor further expands each of the "c" and "r" URIs by
      appending two URL query parameters: "type" indicating
      the name of the DNS resource record type queried and "name"
      indicating the name of the DNS resource record queried.</li>
    </ul>
    
      <aside><t>Note the parial URI value in "c" or "r" will already
      contain zero or more query parameters so implementations should
      substitute "?" and "&amp;" accordingly.</t></aside>
      <ul>
	  
          <li>If a DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
      (<xref target="RFC8310">Section 5 of</xref>) for DoT, the DNS client will either
      fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS
      server provided by the local network or fallback to clear text
      DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.  Both of these
      fallback mechanisms adversely impacts security and privacy.  If
      the DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile for DoT,
      the DNS client MUST ignore the Structured DNS Error EDNS(0) option
      responses, but SHOULD process other parts of the response.</li>
          <li>If a DNS client has enabled strict privacy profile (<xref target="RFC8310">Section 5 of</xref>)
      for DoT, the DNS client requires an encrypted
      connection and successful authentication of the DNS server; this
      mitigates both passive eavesdropping and client redirection (at
      the expense of providing no DNS service if an encrypted,
      authenticated connection is not available).  If the DNS client has
      enabled strict privacy profile for DoT, the client MAY process the
      Structured DNS Error EDNS(0) option of the DNS response.  Note that the
      strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in <xref target="RFC8310"/>
      only apply to DoT; there has been no such distinction
      made for DoH.</li>
          <li>If the DNS client determines that the encrypted DNS server does
      not offer DNS filtering service, it MUST reject the Structured Error
      EDNS(0) option.  For example, the DNS client can learn whether the
      encrypted DNS resolver performs DNS-based content filtering or not
      by retrieving resolver information using the method defined in
      <xref target="I-D.reddy-add-resolver-info"/>.</li>
          <li>DNS forwarders (or DNS proxies) are supposed to propagate unknown
      EDNS(0) options (<xref target="RFC5625">Sections 4.1 and 4.4.1 of</xref>), which means
      the Structured Error EDNS(0) option may get propagated by such a DNS
      server.  To detect this scenario, the DNS client MUST verify the
      domain name in the Structured Error "d" value matches the domain name of the
      encrypted DNS resolver.  If this match fails, the DNS client MUST
      ignore the Structured Error EDNS(0) option in the response, but SHOULD
      process other parts of the response.</li>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Security considerations in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8914"/> and <xref target="RFC8624"/> need to be
      taken into consideration.</t>
      <t>The values of the "c" and "r" keys contain URIs which may cause
      HTTPS retrieval by the client or by another party (e.g., IT staff).    
      To reduce attack surface, the requestor ensures those referenced
      URIs match the domain name of the DNS server, as described in
      section <xref target="process-response"/>.</t>
      <t>To minimize impact of man-in-the-middle attacks on the
      DNS channel, the client validates the response as described
      in <xref target="process-response"/>.</t>
      <t>If the web server responding to "c" or "r" URIs web server
      desires, it can HTTP redirect the request elsewhere, such as
      might be common for "r" to point the user at a government-owned
      domain explaining government-mandated filtering.  To improve
      privacy of such redirection, unnecessary query parameters MUST
      be stripped by the HTTP server from the HTTP target URL.</t>
      <t>In situations where the browser implements encrypted DNS and
      receives the Structured Error EDNS(0) option, and the browser
      visits either of the URIs in the response (c or j), the browser
      SHOULD reduce the attack surface of the client by using an
      isolated environment precautions such as clearly labeling the
      page as untrusted or prevent user interaction with the
      page. Such isolation should prevent transmitting cookies, block
      JavaScript, block auto-fill of credentials or personal
      information, and be isolated from the user's normal
      environment.</t>
      <t>Because this specification still allows DNS filtering to
      respond with an empty answer, NXDOMAIN, or forged answer (as the
      DNS server sees fit), this specification remains incompatible
      with client-based DNSSEC validation.  However, it is possible to
      maintain compatibility with DNSSEC by returning the real (unfiltered)
      answer with its DNSSEC signature intact.  By also returning the
      EDNS(0) Structured Error, the DNS requestor can be informed of
      the filtering (from the DNS responder).  Depending on the threat
      model, network- and/or host-based IP filters or alerts can ensure
      the DNS requestor does not use the DNS response.</t>
      <!--
      <t>The client knows it is connecting to a HTTPS server returning the
      error page. To reduce threat surface the client can retrieve the Error
      Page URL using, for example, an isolated environment and take other
      precautions such as clearly labeling the page as untrusted or prevent
      user interaction with the page. Such isolation should prevent
      transmitting cookies, block JavaScript, block auto-fill of credentials
      or personal information, and be isolated from the user's normal
      environment.</t>

      <t>Browsers perform some of the above restrictions when accessing
      captive portals (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8910"></xref> or <xref
      target="Safari-Cookie"></xref>), during private browsing, or using
      containerization <xref target="Facebook-Container"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that the means to use a sandbox environment and a user interface
      presenting the error page are not covered in this document. By its
      nature, these aspects are implementation specific and best left to the
      application and user interface designers.</t>
