      <t>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
      DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason
      for the filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users
      cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS
      website.</t>

      <t>This document defines a mechanism to explain the reason for the DNS
      filtering and provides HTTPS URIs to get more detail. This information
      can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for other
      purposes.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>DNS filters are deployed for a variety of reasons including endpoint
      security, parental filtering, and filtering required by law enforcement.
      Network-based security solutions such as firewalls and Intrusion
      Prevention Systems (IPS) rely upon network traffic inspection to
      implement perimeter-based security policies and operate by filtering DNS
      responses. In a home, DNS filtering is used for the same reasons as
      above and additionally for parental control. Internet Service Providers
      typically block access to some DNS domains due to a requirement imposed
      by an external entity (e.g., law enforcement agency) also performed
      using DNS-based content filtering.</t>

      <t>Users of DNS services which perform filtering may wish to receive
      more information about such filtering to resolve problems with the
      filter -- for example to contact the administrator to whitelist a domain
      that was erroneously filtered or to understand the reason a particular
      domain was filtered. With that information, the user can choose another
      network, open a trouble ticket with the DNS administrator to resolve
      erroneous filtering, log the information, or other uses.</t>

      <t>Two DNS filtering mechanisms are widely deployed today but are
      harmful:</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
        <dt>empty answer or NXDOMAIN:</dt>
        <dd>The simplest mechanism is simply returning an empty
	    answer or NXDOMAIN.  This provides no information to the
	    client and makes the network or its DNS feel broken
	    because of the 'host not found' error messages typically
	    presented to the user.  This mechanism also interferes
	    with client DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers because the
	    empty answer has an invalid (or missing) signature.</dd>
        <dt>Forged response:</dt>
        <dd>This mechanism returns a forged A (or AAAA) response
      pointing at a host operated by the DNS operator.  The
      expectation is the user's browser will visit the server over
      HTTP and a suitable explanation will be displayed to the user.
      As HTTPS is now commonplace, this expectation breaks down because
      clients are presented with a warning about visiting an
      un-trusted site (because of an un-trusted certificate), or those
      users are encouraged to install the certificate as an additional
      trusted root, eroding their security for all TLS connections.
      Furthermore, for the user to see the DNS filtering explanation
      the user needs a web browser which visits the server and often
      require JavaScript, creating a wider attack surface.  The
      requirement for a web browser is, itself, a problem on some
      devices (e.g., IoT or headless devices).  Finally, this mechanism
      interferes with client DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers because
      the forged response has an invalid (or missing) signature.</dd>
      </dl>
      -->

      <t>DNS responses can be filtered by sending a bogus (also called,
      "forged") A or AAAA response, NXDOMAIN error or empty answer, or an
      extended DNS error (EDE) code defined in <xref target="RFC8914" />. Each
      of these methods have advantages and disadvantages that are discussed
      below:</t>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <t>The DNS response is forged to provide a list of IP addresses that
          points to an HTTP(S) server alerting the end user about the reason
          for blocking access to the requested domain (e.g., malware). When an
          HTTP(S) enabled domain name is blocked, the network security device
          (e.g., CPE, firewall) presents a block page instead of the HTTP
          response from the content provider hosting that domain. If an HTTP
          enabled domain name is blocked, the network security device
          intercepts the HTTP request and returns a block page over HTTP. If
          an HTTPS enabled domain is blocked, the block page is also served
          over HTTPS. In order to return a block page over HTTPS, man in the
          middle (MITM) is enabled on endpoints by generating a local root
          certificate and an accompanying (local) public/private key pair. The
          local root certificate is installed on the endpoint while the
          network security device(s) stores a copy of the private key. During
          the TLS handshake, the network security device modifies the
          certificate provided by the server and (re)signs it using the
          private key from the local root certificate.</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
              is not a viable option in several deployments like home
              networks, schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), and Small/
              Medium Enterprise (SME). In these cases, the typical behavior is
              that the forged DNS response directs the user towards a server
              hosted to display the block page which breaks the TLS
              connection. For web-browsing this then results in an HTTPS
              certificate error message indicating that a secure connection
              could not be established, which gives no information to the
              end-user about the reason for the error. The typical errors are
              "The security certificate presented by this website was not
              issued by a trusted certificate authority" (Internet
              Explorer/Edge"), "The site's security certificate is not
              trusted" (Chrome), "This Connection is Untrusted" (Firefox),
              "Safari can't verify the identity of the website..." (Safari on
              MacOS)".</t>
            </li>

            <li>Enterprise networks do not assume that all the connected
            devices are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device Management
            (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common Bring Your Own
            Device (BYOD) scenario. In addition, the local root certificate
            cannot be installed on IoT devices without a device management
            tool.</li>

            <li>An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
            consequently, may repeatedly try to reach the domain but with no
            success. Frustrated, the end user may switch to an alternate
            network that offers no DNS-level protection against malware and
            phishing, potentially compromising both security and privacy.
            Furthermore, certificate errors train users to click through
            certificate errors, which is a bad security practice. To eliminate
            the need for an end user to click through certificate errors, an
            end user may manually install a local root certificate on a host
            device. Doing so, however, is also a bad security practice as it
            creates a security vulnerability that may be exploited by a MITM
            attack. When a manually installed local root certificate expires,
            the user has to (again) manually install the new local root
            certificate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to cause
        the DNS lookup to terminate in failure. In this case, an end user does
        not know why the domain cannot be reached and may repeatedly try to
        reach the domain but with no success. Frustrated, the end user may use
        insecure connections to reach the domain, potentially compromising
        both security and privacy.</li>

        <li>The extended error codes Blocked, Censored, and Filtered defined
        in <xref target="RFC8914">Section 4 of</xref> can be returned by a DNS
        server to provide additional information about the cause of an DNS
        error. If the extended error code "Forged Answer" defined in <xref
        target="RFC8914">Section 4.5 of</xref> is returned by the DNS server,
        the client can identify the DNS response is forged together with the
        reason for HTTPS certificate error.</li>

        <li>These extended error codes do not suffer from the limitations
        discussed in bullets (1) and (2), but the user still does not know the
        exact reason nor he/she is aware of the exact entity blocking the
        access to the domain. For example, a DNS server may block access to a
        domain based on the content category such as "Adult Content" to
        enforce parental control, "Violence &amp; Terrorism" due to an
        external requirement imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law
        Enforcement Agency), etc. These content categories cannot be
        standardized because the classification of domains into content
        categories is vendor specific, typically ranges from 40 to 100 types
        of categories depending on the vendor and the categories keep
        evolving. Furthermore, the threat data used to categorize domains may
        sometimes misclassify domains (e.g., domains wrongly classified as
        Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) by deep learning techniques, domain
        wrongly classified as phishing due to crowd sourcing, new domains not
        categorized by the threat data). A user needs to know the contact
        details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</li>

        <li>When a resolver or forwarder forwards the received EDE option, the
        EXTRA-TEXT field only conveys the source of the error (Section 3 of
        [RFC8914]) and does not provide additional textual information about
        the cause of the error. <!--  Neil suggested removing these couple of sentences

Most importantly, EDE option does not offer
   authenticated information; it can thus be spoofed by an attacker.
   In addition, the additional textual information may not be able to
   convey all of the required information about the cause of the DNS
   error because lengthy EXTRA-TEXT content would be truncated to
   prevent fragmentation (<xref target="RFC8914">Section 3 of </xref>).
--></li>
      </ol>

      <t>For both DNS filtering mechanisms described above, the DNS server can
      return extended error codes Blocked, Censored, Filtered, or Forged
      Answer defined in <xref target="RFC8914">Section 4 of</xref>. However,
      these codes only explain that filtering occurred but lack detail for the
      user to diagnose erroneous filtering.</t>

      <t>No matter which type of response is generated (forged IP address(es),
      NXDOMAIN or empty answer, even with an extended error code), the user
      who triggered the DNS query has little chance to understand which entity
      filtered the query, how to report a mistake in the filter, or why the
      entity filtered it at all. This document describes a mechanism to
      provide such detail.</t>

      <t>One of the other benefits of this approach is to eliminate the need
      to "spoof" block pages for HTTPS resources. This is achieved since
      clients implementing this approach would be able to display a meaningful
      error message, and would not need to connect to such a block page. This
      approach thus avoids the need to install a local root certificate
      authority on those IT-managed devices.</t>

      <t>This document describes a format for computer-parsable data in the
      EXTRA-TEXT field of <xref target="RFC8914">Extended DNS
      Errors</xref>.</t>

      <t>This document does not recommend DNS filtering but provides a
      mechanism for better transparency to explain to the users why some DNS
      queries are filtered.</t>

          text DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages. Both of these
          fallback mechanisms adversely impacts security and privacy. If the
          DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile for DoT, the
          DNS client MUST ignore the EXTRA-TEXT field of the EDE responses,
          but SHOULD process other parts of the response.</li>

          <li>If a DNS client has enabled strict privacy profile (<xref
          target="RFC8310">Section 5 of</xref>) for DoT, the DNS client
          requires an encrypted connection and successful authentication of
          the DNS server; this mitigates both passive eavesdropping and client
          redirection (at the expense of providing no DNS service if an
          encrypted, authenticated connection is not available). If the DNS
          client has enabled strict privacy profile for DoT, the client MAY
          process the EXTRA-TEXT field of the DNS response. Note that the
          strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in <xref
          target="RFC8310" /> only apply to DoT; there has been no such
          distinction made for DoH.</li>

          <li>If the DNS client determines that the encrypted DNS server does
          not offer DNS filtering service, it MUST discard the EXTRA-TEXT
          field of the EDE response. For example, the DNS client can learn
          whether the encrypted DNS resolver performs DNS-based content
          filtering or not by retrieving resolver information using the method
          defined in <xref target="I-D.reddy-add-resolver-info" />.</li>

          <li>When a forwarder receives an EDE option, whether or not (and
          how) to pass along JSON information in the EXTRA-TEXT on to their
          client is implementation dependent <xref target="RFC5625" />.
          Implementations MAY choose to not forward the JSON information, or
          they MAY choose to create a new EDE option that conveys the
          information in the "j" and "d" fields encoded in the JSON object. To
          check if the EXTRA-TEXT originated from its server (rather than by
          something further upstream) the DNS client MUST verify the domain
          name in the Structured Error "d" value matches the domain name of
          the encrypted DNS resolver. If this match fails, the DNS client
          discards the EXTRA-TEXT field.</li>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>Security considerations in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8914" />
      apply to this document.</t>

      <t>To minimize impact of active on-path attacks on the DNS channel, the
      client validates the response as described in <xref
      target="process-response" />.</t>

      <t>A client might choose to display the information in the EXTRA-TEXT
      field if and only if the encrypted resolver has sufficient reputation,
      according to some local policy (e.g. user configuration, administrative
      configuration, or a built-in list of respectable resolvers). This limits
      the ability of a malicious encrypted resolver to cause harm. If the
      client decides not to display the all of the information in the
      EXTRA-TEXT field, it can be logged for diagnostics purpose and the
      client can only display the resolver hostname that blocked the domain
      and error description for the EDE code to the end-user.</t>

      <t>If the browser visits either of the URIs in the response ("c" or
      "r"), the browser SHOULD reduce the attack surface of the client by
      using an isolated environment precautions such as clearly labeling the
      page as untrusted or prevent user interaction with the page. Such
      isolation should prevent transmitting cookies, block JavaScript, block
      auto-fill of credentials or personal information, and be isolated from
      the user's normal environment. The user's preferred language SHOULD be
      included in the Content-Language header.</t>

      <t>When displaying the free-form text of "o" and "j", the browser SHOULD
      NOT make any of those elements into actionable (clickable) links.</t>

      <t>Although the "d" value is validated, an attacker who is able to
      inject (or modify) the EXTRA-TEXT field so that a DNS proxy or DNS
      forwarder, unaware of the option, will forward it and pass the
      validation checks described in <xref target="process-response" />. This
      means the other JSON fields can be controlled by the attacker. The "j"
      and "o" fields are, perhaps, the most interesting for an attacker to
      modify for nefarious purposes, because the "d" field has to match the
      encrypted DNS server's name and the expanded URIs from the "c" and "r"
      will point at the DNS resolver not under the attacker's control.</t>

      <aside>
        <t>The authors anticipate enhancements to <xref
        target="I-D.reddy-add-resolver-info" /> will reduce or eliminate the
        concern described in previous paragraph.</t>
      </aside>

      <!--
      <t>Because this specification still allows DNS filtering to
      respond with an empty answer, NXDOMAIN, or forged answer (as the
      DNS server sees fit), this specification remains incompatible
      with client-based DNSSEC validation. However, it is possible to
      maintain compatibility with DNSSEC by returning the real (unfiltered)
      answer with its DNSSEC signature intact. By also returning the
      EDNS(0) Structured Error, the DNS requestor can be informed of
      the filtering (from the DNS responder).</t>
-->

      <!--
      <t>The client knows it is connecting to an HTTPS server returning the
      error page. To reduce threat surface the client can retrieve the Error
      Page URL using, for example, an isolated environment and take other
      precautions such as clearly labeling the page as untrusted or prevent
      user interaction with the page. Such isolation should prevent
      transmitting cookies, block JavaScript, block auto-fill of credentials
      or personal information, and be isolated from the user's normal
      environment.</t>

      <t>Browsers perform some of the above restrictions when accessing
      captive portals (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8910"></xref> or <xref
      target="Safari-Cookie"></xref>), during private browsing, or using
      containerization <xref target="Facebook-Container"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that the means to use a sandbox environment and a user interface
      presenting the error page are not covered in this document. By its
      nature, these aspects are implementation specific and best left to the
      application and user interface designers.</t>
